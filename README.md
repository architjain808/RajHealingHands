## 💡 The Problem

Small healthcare clinics and independent physiotherapists in India often struggle with:

- **Zero online visibility** — Patients searching for physiotherapy in their area can't find them on the web.
- **No easy way to reach out** — Phone calls are the only option, leading to missed appointments and lost inquiries, especially after clinic hours.
- **Scattered patient records** — Paper-based record-keeping makes it nearly impossible to track treatment history, follow-ups, or generate reports.
- **No credibility signal** — Without an online presence, potential patients have no way to verify the clinic's services, expertise, or patient reviews before visiting.

> *For a solo physiotherapist running a clinic in Tapovan, Rishikesh, these aren't just inconveniences — they're barriers to helping patients who genuinely need care.*
